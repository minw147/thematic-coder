## Overview
The Thematic Coder AI is a sophisticated web application designed to revolutionize the process of qualitative data analysis. Built for researchers, marketers, and product managers, this tool leverages the power of the Google Gemini API to automate the time-consuming task of thematically coding open-ended survey responses. It provides a seamless, end-to-end workflow that takes users from raw CSV data to insightful, interactive reports, transforming a traditionally manual process into an efficient, AI-assisted exploration of user feedback.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js 18+ (Node 20 recommended)

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Start the development server (hot reload):
   `npm run dev`
3. Or build and preview the production bundle:
   `npm run build`
   `npm run preview`

When the app opens, click the settings (gear) icon and enter your Gemini API key. The key is stored in your browser's localStorage; no `.env` file is required for local development.

If you see a blank page, hard refresh the browser (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R).
